## API Integration

The system integrates with your backend API. Update the API endpoints in `apis.tsx` to match your backend structure.

### Expected API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/download/getdownloads` - Get all downloads
- `GET /api/v1/download/getdownloadbyid/:id` - Get download by ID
- `POST /api/v1/download/adddownload` - Create new download
- `PUT /api/v1/download/updatedownload/:id` - Update download
- `DELETE /api/v1/download/deletedownload/:id` - Delete download

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface DownloadItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  fileUrl: string;        // Cloudinary URL
  fileName: string;       // Original filename
  fileSize: string;       // Formatted size (e.g., "2.5 MB")
  uploadDate: string;     // YYYY-MM-DD format
  downloadCount: number;  // Number of downloads
  isActive: boolean;      // Active/inactive status
}
```

## PDF Upload Workflow

1. **User selects PDF file** from their device
2. **File validation** checks type and size
3. **Upload to Cloudinary** using existing configuration
4. **Cloudinary URL** is stored in the database
5. **Backend receives** only the URL, not the file itself

This follows your preferred pattern of uploading files to Cloudinary first, then sharing URLs with the backend.

## Validation Rules
